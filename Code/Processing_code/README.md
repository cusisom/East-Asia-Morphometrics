# Processing Code

This folder exists to hold the .r script used to clean and consolidate the raw data provided by Dr. Kat Platchard. The goal in data processing was to format the data into an easy to read structure and to prepare it for morphometric analysis. This mostly entailed merging the demographic data from `Raw_classifiers` with the metric data for visualization and then formating the data frames into arrays for analysis. 

## Folder Contents

The three files (besides this README) all encompass the same material.

	`processingcode.r` = The script developed for organizing the data
	`processing.qmd` = The markdown file used for presentation
	`processing.html` = An easy to follow walkthrough and visualization of the processing effort.
