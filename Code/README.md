# Project Code

The two subfolders listed above divide the r code into two operations. The original data for this project (found in the `Data/Raw_data` folder) was provided by an outside source and compiled into three excel spreadsheets. Because of the current format and unknown condition of the provided material, this project dedicates a separate folder (`Processing_code`) to piecing the data together and getting it into workable condition for analysis. 

The `Analysis_code` folder will be used for statistical analyses and for the production of Tables and FIgures for the final manuscript.
