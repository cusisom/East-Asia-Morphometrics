# Analysis Code

This folder holds the .r script for data analysis. Included also in this folder is the Quarto file used to visualize each step of the analysis process. The .html file leads to easy access for project visualization. 

## Folder Contents

The three code files all encompass the same material.

	`EAanalysis.r` = The script developed for data analysis
	`EAanalysis.qmd` = The markdown file created for presentation of analysis.
	`EAanalysis.html` = An easy to follow walkthrough and visualization of my analysis.

Additionally, there are four image files that are used in my EAanalysis.qmd. 
	`d1array.png` = Anterior view of array plot
	`d1array1.png` = Lateral view of array plot
	`d1Graphic.png` = Anterior view of mean shape plot
	`d1Graphic2.png` = Lateral view of mean shape plot

## Viewing

Readers are encouraged to review the .html to understand the goals and steps taken throughout this project.

## History

As of 4/29/2023 there is still a lot of work to do on the analysis. More to come.
