# Analysis Code

This folder will eventuall hold the .r script for data analysis. Included also in this folder is the Quarto file used to visualize each step of the analysis process. The .html leads to easy access for project visualization. 

`analysis.qmd` is the working file for the .html. I'm choosing to do this so that I can monitor what has and has not been developed during my analysis.
