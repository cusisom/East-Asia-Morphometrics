This project is centered around original research from Dr. Kat Platchard (formerly Kat Harrington) conducted for her PhD dissertaion at UH Manoa, 2020. I will use this .html to act as my notes page in the process of cleaning and analyzing the given data. I am not currently sure it this will be able to pull code chunks from two separate codes, but I will find out.

# Goal 1

My first goal for this project will be to consolidate the three spreadsheets provided into a single dataset. An additional need here will be to define all of the measurements in the datasets that are currently marked by acronyms.
