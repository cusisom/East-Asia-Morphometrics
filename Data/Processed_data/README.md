# Processed Data

This folder will be populated by three documents. The processed data will be saved here in .csv and .rds formats. In addition to the processed data files, the data dictionary will also be stored here as a .csv file. 

# Contents

The files in this folder include the reorganized data into datasets with associated demographic information and datasets formated as arrays for morphometric analysis. Each file was written in .csv and .rds formats. 

	`Japan_array.csv` = Japan data ready for morphometric analysis
	`Japan_array.rds` = Japan data ready for morphometric analysis
	`Korea_array.csv` = Korea data ready for morphometric analysis
	`Korea_array.rds` = Korea data ready for morphometric analysis
	
	`Japan_dem.csv` = Japan data merged with pertinent demographic data from the `Raw_classifiers.csv` file provided by the original investigator. 
	`Japan_dem.rds` = Japan data merged with pertinent demographic data from the `Raw_classifiers.csv` file provided by the original investigator. 
	`Korea_dem.csv` = Korea data merged with pertinent demographic data from the `Raw_classifiers.csv` file provided by the original investigator. 
	`Korea_dem.rds` = Korea data merged with pertinent demographic data from the `Raw_classifiers.csv` file provided by the original investigator. 

	`d1Links.csv` = Wiremesh data for Japanese morphometrics
	`d1Links.rds` = Wiremesh data for Japanese morphometrics
