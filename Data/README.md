# Data

Material in this folder includes the original morphometrics dataset provided by Dr. Kat Platchard. This material was used in her dissertation on Distinguishing Closely Related Modern Human Populations Using Cranial Morphometrics: A View from Korea and Japan.

## Folder Contents

The two subfolders found here store the original content, the output files from the data processing code, and the data dictionary (*soon to come*). 

### Raw Data 

The Data provided for this project (found in the `Raw_data` folder) is divided into three separate Excel files. Additionally, there was no data dictionary provided. Two immediate goals of this project are to use the material in this folder to generate a consolidated data file and to develop the data dictionary.

### Processed Data

The material found in this folder is what will be used for my data analysis. Accordingly, the files from the `Raw_data` folder will not be altered. All data cleaned, processed, and consolidated, including the developed data dictionary can be found in the `Processed_data` folder.
