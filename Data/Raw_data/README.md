# Raw Data

The data observable in this folder remains unaltered from that provided by Dr. Kat Platchard. For use of this data, the original author should be contacted. 

## Contents

All of the files in this folder, besides this ReadMe and the `Cranial_landmarks.csv`, were provided by Dr. Platchard. These provided files include the following:

	`Raw_Japan.csv` = Raw 3D Geometric Morphometric data on crania from Japan.
	`Raw_korea.csv` = Raw 3D Geometric Morphometric data on crania from Korea.
	`Raw_classifiers.csv` = Demographic data (including Sex, Population, and Period) for all specimens in study. 

The `Cranial_landmarks.csv` was included by me as a data dictionary. This is the only data file used in this study that was not provided by the original investigator.
