# East Asia Morphometrics

This repo exists to collect, organize and maintain data pertaining to the final project for 'Zoology 710: Data Science in R for Biologists'. This final project is directed at a 3D Geometric Morphometric analysis of Craniometric Variation on modern and historical populations in Japan and Korea. The analysis is built off of the original dissertation (Distinguishing Closely Related Modern Human Populations Using Cranial Morphometrics: A View From Korea And Japan) by Kat Platchard published to satisfy the requirements for the PhD program in Anthropology at UH Manoa (2020). 

## History

2023-04-04 Creation of Repository, creation of Data and Code folders, and import of original dataset. 

## Acknowledgement

This work adds to the original dissertation by Dr. Kat Platchard (formerly Kat Harrington) (Harrington, 2020).

## Software Requirements

This project and report uses R, Quarto, Github and a reference manager for bibtex. A plain text editor is also necessary, and wordprocessing software to open .docx (e.g. MS Word, MacOS Pages, or LibreOffice).

## Repository Content

Please see the `README.md` files for each folder. 

This repository is primarily organized into four folders:

*The `Data` folder is subdivided into `Raw_data` and `Processed_data`. The Raw data found here will remain unaltered. Any changes made to the dataset will be saved as processed data.

*The `Code` folder will be used for all r scripts. It is yet unclear how this folder will be subdivided.

*The `Products` folder contains all final output materials including the developing Manuscript, bibtex references, and presentation material. 

*The `Results` folder contains all statistical Figures and Tables(.rds files).
